# cse430-project-2 
Scheduling Queues

This is a project from our CSE 430 Operating Systems class at Arizona State University.  There is a project specification PDF located inside 

    /cse430-project-2/extras/specifications/.

Included in this project is a makefile, a test script, and test cases (only one so far, more to come). To run the test script, run:

    /cse430-project-2/extras/testing/test_script.sh
  
The test script will call the makefile to build the project, then compare the test input/output to the expected output, show if there are any differences (and WHAT the differences are), then will clean up any files it created during the building and testing stages. Finally, it will give you a score of how many test cases passed and how many failed.
